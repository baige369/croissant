          A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian
          origin, but mostly associated with France.
        </strong>
        <br />
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
        viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is
        layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
        rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
        results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
